The classic Tetris game we all loved ones appon a time.

I tried to create this without any tutorial and that's the result i got.

To play it clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kontopodis/tetris.git
```

And then:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Have fun.

This was one of the best projects to learn Javascript and Pixi.js
If you want to learn and build your own you shouldn't  look into the code much. You can do it alone...
it's easy.
